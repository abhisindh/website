In the world of data structures, linked lists stand as one of the fundamental building blocks for efficient data manipulation and storage. Imagine a scenario where you're managing a contact list for your favorite social media platform. Each user profile is like a node in a linked list, connected by relationships. This real-world example demonstrates the power of linked lists, where connections between data elements pave the way for flexible and dynamic data management. In this blog, we will delve into the depths of linked lists, exploring their types, operations, and implementation using code snippets in the C programming language.
