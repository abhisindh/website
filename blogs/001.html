    <h5 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h5>

    <p>
        Imagine you are a librarian in a busy library, tasked with managing an ever growing collection of books.
                You start with a set number of bookshelves neatly organized with a fixed number of slots of books.
                However as more and more book-enthusiasts visit your library, the shelves fill up, and you are faced with a dilemma
                - what if you run out of space for new books ?
    </p>
    <p>
        The arrays in normal programming usage is like the book shelf of fixed size. You can access book in any shelf easily and can place a book 
                in an empty slot. But the problem arises when there are more books than there are slots. What will you do?

        Enter
        <span>Dynamic Array</span>
        the data structre that combines the strength of array - constant-time access - with the flexibility of automatic resizing.With dynamic arrays, you can elegantly handle collections that need to expand or contract as your program runs.

    <h5 id="section1" class="sub-heading">Understanding Dynamic Arrays: A Primer</h5>
    <p>
    A dynamic array is a data structure that provides an adaptable approach to storing collections of elements. Unlike static arrays, whose size is fixed during declaration, dynamic arrays dynamically adjust their capacity to accommodate varying amounts of data. This adjustment, or automatic resizing, ensures that programmers can efficiently manage evolving datasets without the need for manual memory allocation and reallocation.
    </p>

    <p>Dynamic arrays are very helpful in the following scenarios:</p>
    <p>
        <span>Lists and Containers</span>: Dynamic arrays excel in scenarios where the number of elements is uncertain or subject to change, such as implementing lists, stacks, and queues.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Data Analysis and Manipulation</span>: Dynamic arrays are pivotal in handling data structures for data analysis, where datasets may vary in size and complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>User Interfaces</span>: GUI elements like lists or grids benefit from dynamic arrays, accommodating dynamic content changes without compromising user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Resizing Image Buffers</span>: Applications dealing with image processing or multimedia often require resizable buffers, making dynamic arrays an ideal choice
